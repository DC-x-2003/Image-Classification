# Image-Classification:
A Deep Learning Project consisting of image classification and gradio interface for recognising and classifying traffic signs.
Here we will be using Convolutional Neural Networks beacuse of their superior performance with image inputs.
## Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images and videos. CNNs are particularly powerful for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and image classification because they can automatically learn and extract meaningful features from the data.

<br>
Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are:
<br>


1 . Convolutional layer
<br>
2 . Pooling layer
<br>
3 . Fully-connected (FC) layer
<br>

## What are we doing in this project?
In this particular project we will be working upon Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). We are using CNN because of its superior performance with image classification models.

<br>

Here we are classifying three categories of traffic signs namely:
<br>
<br>

[a] No Parking
[b] One Way
[c] Zebra Crossing
<br>

## How did we collect our data?
Most of our images is collected by us through mobile photography. We went to multiple roads and clicked the photos of our desired traffic signs and aggregated them together in the form of a dataset. 
<br>
Some of our images is also collected through online sources and then we combined every photos to form a perfect dataset of images with the same image type. 
We also went through the street view of google maps and captured the images of traffic signs in the form of screenshot.
<br>

## Procedure
### Importing libraries
The necessary libraries are imported for preprocessing and model creation.
<br>

### Importing data file
Dataset is uploaded for the further use
<br>

### Preprocessing
Data is rescaled and normalised in order to maintain uniformity. Here uniformity means converting all the images to a fixed size for better performance of model.
<br>
A little bit of data augmentation has also been performed.
<br>

### Model creation 
A Sequential model using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is created.
We are using three input layers and three dense layers along with dropout layers.
